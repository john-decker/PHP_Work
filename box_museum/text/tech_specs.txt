<h3>The Device and its Use:</h3>
<h4>Hardware</h4> 
Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Micro:Bit, Adafruit PN 532 RFID/NFC Board, USB Speakers, LED

<h4>Software</h4>
There are three main programs for this device. Two work together to safely shut down the Raspberry Pi without having to pull the plug from the wall: <em>safe_shutdown_pi.py</em> and <em>micro_bit_as_switch.py</em>. The third, <em>rfid_reader_pyth2.py</em>, drives the PN 532 board to sense tags, uses the Pygame mixer function to play sound files when specific RFID tags are sensed, and controls an LED. <em>Safe_shutdown_pi.py</em> is written in Python 3, <em>micro_bit_as switch.py</em> is written in Micro Python, and <em>rfid_reader_pyth2.py</em> is written in Python 2. Each of these files is available on my <a href="https://github.com/john-decker/Adafruit_Python_PN532" target="blank">Git Hub repository</a>. The RFID driver code employed in this version of the device was written for Python 2 and is dependent on the Adafruit PN 532 library developed for it. I cloned the Adafruit driver library from <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PN532" target="blank">Tony DiCola’s Git Repository</a> onto the Pi and forked it to my Git repository. The library was available under an MIT license. A Fritzing diagram for wiring the components together is available to the right. 

<h4>Peripheral Objects</h4>
Currently, there are three objects each with its own RFID tag: a figurine, a pomander, and a sheet of music. The 3D objects are made from Sculpey; the 2D item is glued to foam core. Placing these over the sensor will trigger audio files that contain information about each item. The sound files are each between one-minute-thirty seconds and one-minute-forty seconds in length. In addition, there is an Administrator’s fob that exits the RFID reader program: a sound file is also played when this item is placed above the sensor. Finally, the objects and the reader are housed in boxes made from foam core.

<h4>Associated Files</h4>
I created four distinct sound files using Audacity and saved each in the .wav format. The audio files contain information about each object. I acted as the narrator for the voice sections and used Audacity to shorten and splice together public domain sound files from <a href="https://archive.org/details/GregorianChantMass/" target="blank">archive.org</a> for the music.

<h4>Normal Operation</h4>
The prototype box only needs to be plugged into wall power. Once powered, the safe shut down programs (both on the pi and on the Micro:Bit) as well as the RFID reader software will boot automatically. The indicator light on the front of the box will show whether or not the RFID reader is active. While active, users can take any of the peripheral objects from an accompanying container and place them on the silver circle on top of the box. The circle is positioned over the RFID reader antenna, which will sense the RFID tags attached to each object. The tags are associated with individual sound files that will play once the reader has recognized a tag. There are two speakers included in the box that will output the sound when the appropriate files are played. The speaker volume can be adjusted via a volume wheel accessible through the back of the box. When it is time to put the objects away and shut down the unit, use the Administrator’s fob.  The Administrator’s fob will exit the RFID reader program at which point a music file will play, the indicator light will blink twice, and then the light will turn off to signal that the RFID reader is no longer active. Finally, the unit can be shut down safely by pressing the B button of the Micro:Bit. The buttons and display of the Micro:Bit are visible and accessible through the back of the box.
