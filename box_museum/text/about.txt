This site is based on, and inspired by, the work of the <a href=https://museuminabox.org>Museum in a Box</a> company, which works with museums in the UK to make cultural goods more accessible to all.<br /><br />The focus of the box museum website (an homage to the original project) is on late-medieval and Renaissance objects and art works found in museums all over the world. It is meant for study and teaching purposes only. In addition to this site is a purpose-built box museum. This unit, also inspired by the work of the Museum in a Box company, is based on a Raspberry Pi with RFID reader. Replica items are fitted with RFID tags which, when read, play audio files about each object.
