For people in the late-middle ages and Renaissance it was important to prepare properly for death.  This was especially true for devout Christians.<br /><br />Death could come in many ways -- war, famine, accident, natural catastrophe, or illnesses like the Plague. For many, the most feared way to die was to do so suddenly. The faithful believed that such a death could have severe consequences for the afterlife.<br /><br />Before the Protestant Rupture (1515 CE), the faithful believed that the soul was constantly in a struggle for salvation. The battle for one’s soul was waged up to the moment when it departed the body and its outcome was not certain. A devout soul could experience a moment of temptation or doubt and be lost. A sinful soul could find a moment of true repentance and be saved.<br /><br />The struggles of the soul on one’s death bed were important enough that religious writers created the <em>Ars Moriendi</em> (Art of Dying Well) to help Christians face death and increase the chances of attaining heaven (or at least Purgatory). The <em>Ars</em> tells the story of a dying man named <em>Moriens</em> who faces many temptations and struggles as his body grows weaker. With the help of the angels and saints who encourage him along the way, he is able to die well and goes to Heaven. Though the book was originally written in Latin, by the 15th century it was translated into various other languages that the laity could read<br /><br />Later Protestant thought, based on the doctrine of <em>Sola Fidianism</em> (salvation by faith alone), changed some of these beliefs but not entirely. For Protestants, rituals and procedures (like those in the <em>Ars Moriendi</em>) made no difference in one’s fate. Only God could ordain salvation or damnation and only God knew where the soul was predestined to go at death.<br /><br />The changes brought about by the Protestant Rupture were slow and many continued to use the rites, procedures, and objects to which they were accustomed.<br /><br />People carried various items with them -- rings, prayer beads, talismans, and other objects -- as protections against a sudden death.<br /><br />Wealthier members of society commissioned funerary objects to help ensure that people remembered them. Bronze plaques, paintings, statuettes, and lavish funeral chapels in the Parish church worked to keep the deceased person's memory alive and acted as prompts asking the community to pray for their souls.
