<h3>Welcome</h3>
Much like the world in which we live, people in the late-middle ages and Renaissance made and used many different items. Some objects and images were used to express religious ideas and feelings. Others were tools for announcing one's status to the world. And, others still were part of the normal routines of home and hearth.<br /><br />Many of these items were created by craftspeople whose names rarely, if ever, survive in the records and, often, they remain "Anonymous" to us. The images represented in the three categories here, and in the entire collection, are largely the work of such Anonymous makers.<br /><br />Each category contains a small sample of the sorts of things in circulation over 500 years ago.
