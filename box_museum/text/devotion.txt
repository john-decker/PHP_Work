Scholars used to think that religion was all-pervasive in the late-middle ages and Renaissance. According to this view, daily life was structured by religious obligation that everyone observed equally. This perception has changed over time. Scholars now understand that not everyone was deeply religious.<br /><br />As with society today, religious sentiment in the late-medieval period and Renaissance depended on the individual, time of year, and prevailing circumstances.<br /><br />Some members of society were religious in name only, fulfilling religious obligations when absolutely necessary. This may have been a larger portion of society than one might expect given that the Church had to pass strict rules requiring all Christians to take Communion at least once per year. Others attended regularly but for the purposes of gaining promised benefits such as protection against sudden death. Reform-minded critics of lay practice describe, for example, how parishioners would run from church to church to see the Host (the wafer that was believed to be the body of Christ) elevated during the Mass because it was widely thought that seeing it would protect one from death for the day. More devout Christians attended services regularly and made religion part of their daily lives. Some of these, carried out devotional practices such as saying prayer-cycles, meditating on the life of the Virgin, Christ, or the saints, or even taking religious journeys in their imaginations.<br /><br />Devotional acts did not necessarily require any images or objects to complete them. A devout layperson could meditate on a passage from scripture, on a preacher's sermon, or on stories from popular books like Jacopo de Voragine's <em>Golden Legend</em>, which was a compilation of the lives of the saints.<br /><br />For many, however, images and objects provided a beneficial point of focus for their efforts. Devotional items could range from inexpensive statuettes made from pipe-clay or strands of prayer beads made from bone, to pomanders (scent balls) made from copper, silver, or gold, to panel paints, to lavishly illustrated books of prayers.<br /><br />No matter what material it was made from, a devotional object (or image) was a tool that Christians could use to help turn their innermost selves toward the divine. Some items (prayer beads, scent balls, jewelry) were intensely personal. They were carried on the body, held and touched, and were often buried with their owners. Others (devotional paintings, large statues) could be both personal and communal. A painting or statue in a home was likely meant for the occupants of that place and their visitors. When situated in a church or chapel. similar items were likely also meant for members of the community.<br /><br />Not only were devotional items aids for helping individuals or groups turn their souls toward God and salvation, the were also status items that announced to the rest of the world the owner's devotion to her or his religion as well as her or his socio-economic status and buying power.
