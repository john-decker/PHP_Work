Scholars used to say that society in the late-middle ages and Renaissance was broken into three categories -- <em>Bellatores</em> (those who wage war, the nobility), <em>Oratores</em> (those who pray, the clergy), and <em>Laboratores</em> (those who labor, everyone else). That view has changed and we now see social structures in this period as being far more complex.<br /><br />The nobility were not all one rank but varied from so-called "petty" nobles who had a birthright to land but not much else to Queens and Emperors who controlled vast areas through force, money, charisma (or combinations of them).<br /><br />The clergy were likewise divided into various levels. Not only was there a well-defined rank system from priests (and those who assisted them) to bishops, cardinals, and the pope but there were also distinctions based on affiliation with particular orders. These orders, in turn, were subjects to various ups-and-downs of status over time. The Cluniacs, for example, were highly esteemed but lost favor when the Carthusians came along. The Franciscans and Dominicans were in a long-term rivalry with each other and, depending on public opinion of them, their influence waxed or waned accordingly. An order's reputation was important as it brought social and spiritual legitimacy that was needed to be effective in communities and territories throughout the Christian West.<br /><br />The laboring class was hardly an undifferentiated whole. Multiple social layers existed among the non-noble, non-clerical majority. The humblest were homeless vagabonds who moved from place to place, trying to find a way to stay alive. Those who worked the fields were also humble but even they had differences. On the one hand, there were common farm laborers who worked the fields for someone else for a wage (food, money, combinations of them) Freemen, on the other hand, could own plots of land, keep what they produced, and pass their land to their children. Farm workers, freemen or otherwise, lived outside towns and cities. Inside municipal walls, there were differences between residents and citizens (citizens had certain rights that residents did not). Further, there were differences between craftspeople, tradespeople, various forms of merchants, social and religious community groups, and those eligible to be on the town council and those who were not.<br /><br />People signaled their social differences in many ways. Houses, clothing, personal items (jewelry, books, dish-ware, etc.) all played a role in declaring someone's social standing and wealth (or lack of it).<br /><br />Not surprisingly, those who had a great deal of money, power, and influence were able to purchase high-quality items that survive the centuries. Plates with personal mottoes, funerary objects, shields and armor, commemorative items that celebrate royal weddings, and artistic commissions like portraits or altarpieces destined for influential parish churches provide ample testimony to the use of objects to assert personal, or communal, identity and status.
